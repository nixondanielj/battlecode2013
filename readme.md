Current Status of Master:

HQ rapidly spawns soldiers
Soldiers kamikaze blindly towards the enemy base

All in all, not a winning combination

Thoughts:

RobotFactory handling dependency injection and construction of concrete objects. Make sure you abstract away far enough that new functionality is dropped in like a package.

Needed:

broadcasting package

more thorough mapper

soldier priorities/workflow

better pathing - there appear to be no obstacles besides other units in this version. Do we need to compensate for sensed mines or should we prioritize removing them?
