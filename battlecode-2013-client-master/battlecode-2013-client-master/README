Battlecode Client

BUILDING

!!! Now that the 3D viewer is up and running, you'll need a couple more jars, specifically:
- jogl.all.jar
- gluegen-rt.jar

All of these jars can be found on http://jogamp.org

You have to build the server before the client. This process builds both. You need an existing battlecode distribution for the updated jogl.jar file, and everything else.

1. cd into your workspace
2. git clone https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-server.git
3. cd battlecode-server
4. mkdir -p ~/.ant/lib
5. ant download-ivy
6. ant retrieve
7. ant jar
8. cp battlecode-server.jar battlecode_distro/
9. cd ..
10. git clone https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode-client.git
11. ant retrieve
12. cp ../battlecode-server/battlecode-server.jar lib/
13. cp battlecode_distro/jogl.jar lib/
14. ant jar
15. cp battlecode-client.jar battlecode_distro/

Enjoy your new build!
